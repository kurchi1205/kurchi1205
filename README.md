## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
I am Prerana, passionate about solving complex business problems and not afraid of pushing my limits into unknown domains. 
I may not be knowing everything, but it's my attitude towards work that helps me get things done.

## TECH STACK 
### ML Stack

<br>
My day to day tasks are mainly using Pytorch and Numpy, for monitoring and saving checkpoints, I use WandB and MlFlow. For handling big data I use pola-rs, which is similar to Pandas but a lot faster.

### Framework Stack

<br>
Over the course of 1.8 years, I have extensively worked with these frameworks as well as Pydantic for Data Validation

### Hosting Stack

I use cloud services for run training on high end GPUs and deploying models using Cloudrun or Vertex. Also I use versioning system for data to maintain large amount of data in an organized manner.

### Languages

## STARTUP EXP
I work in a startup environment, so ownership of modules are very high!!
### Use Cases (10000ft Level)
(ofc I can't talk details about these things)
- Forming composition for layouts
- Colorizing an image
- Generating images using Stable Diffusion
- Prompt Engineering
